### Indie Developer


I'm an undergraduate from Academy of Interactive Entertainment, and I specialize in Video Game Programming and Development. As a naturally curious individual, I am always driven by learning new things and overcoming obstacles.

I have worked on a few shipped games with my past team members, and I have a plethora of projects on my GitHub ranging from Artificial Intelligence to cross platform development.


Engines: Unity and Unreal Engine
Languages: C# and C++
