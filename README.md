### Game Programmer



I'm currently a student at Academy of Interactive Entertainment learning programming and game development. So far I have helped create 2 games with my team, and I'm also working on a few personal ones on my own.
I have 2 years of coding in unity and 1 year in unreal engine 4, but I have learned so much about both engines.
Other projects that I have worked on include data structures, linked lists, Creating a library from scratch for visual studio, cross platform development, and AI.

Languages: C# and C++
